# TinyApp

A full stack web app built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

## Purpose

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
